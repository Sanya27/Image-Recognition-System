# Image-Recognition-System
A system to detect if a given image is of a Vada-pav or not! ( similar to hot-dog or not from silicon valley!) The task includes collecting the data, augmenting it and training the deep learning model to achieve the functionality.
The data sets can be changed to accomodate other image recognition tasks.
